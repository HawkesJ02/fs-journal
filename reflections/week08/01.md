## Questions

1. What function does a developer Portfolio provide?

- Shows off the skillset of the devoloper in a professional way. Proves you know what you know

2. What makes a Developer Portfolio effective?

- Having one with many projects that look well done and professional. Multiple things done in multiple ways.

3. What projects do you have that you would include in your Portfolio? Why?

- Obviously the capstone here, but I want to also polish up the network or tower for example to show off. The final will most likely be another.
