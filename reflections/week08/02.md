## Questions

1. Why is communication on a small team important?

- Communication is important to not only get across your messages but also convey what you are doing and when. This helps avoid conflicts and other problems down the line.

2. What adjustments from traditional sized scrum teams need to be made to use the agile methodology effectively in a small team?

One person becomes what a "team" would do if that makes sense. A dev team might only be two of us when normally there could be more, we all have to take up roles that normally have more people.

3. What is the unattainable triangle? What are the tradeoffs of each side?

- Trade off of speed, quality and money. Fast service is cheap but wont be good, good service is expensive and wont be fast, ect.
