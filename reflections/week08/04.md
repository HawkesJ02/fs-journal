## Questions

1. What are the three main types of testing we can accomplish in Vue? What does each method provide?

- Unit testing, component testing and end to end testing. Unit lets bits of codes to be isolated and tested. Component testing does what it says and test components. end to end test for pretty much everything.

2. What testing method do you think is the most useful? Why?

- I can see myself using component testing the most since its inbetween isolated and end to end. It just seems like it would help the most for the level I want testing to be.

3. What testing method do you think is the least useful? Why?

- End to end seems the least useful, at least at the start. since it test for everything then it might be hard to isolate problems.
