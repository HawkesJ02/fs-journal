## Questions

1. In simple terms what is timeboxing?

- spending needed times on task, without staying on one for far too long. Don't let a bug hang you up for 4 hours when you need to take care of other things. Easy to manage units of time.

2. What three strategies will you implement and how?

- I like the strategic quitting as it both sounds funny but is very useful. Knowing (my own) golden hour is also helpful, even if for me its at incredibly strange times like 2am. Swallow the frog is also a strange sounding one but also quite important, go and getting at it even if I don't want to.


3. Give an example of when you would have benefitted from timeboxing and how? 

- When I have a lot of task to do I am terrible at timeboxing. Checkpoints for example I let myself get stuck on a bug for far too long before I should say to move on and try doing something else first.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment

- A fun project, but the virtuals are something I will still need to tinker around with for a bit. I get what they do but its hard for me to wrap my brain about where to input them and how to exactly use them.
