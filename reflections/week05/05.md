# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?
  - backend was great, it has less of a nice sleek UI but also due to this its much easier to work with. I like the raw data and turning into something useable and its pretty quick if you know you did it right.
- What did you learn as a shock or suprise?
  - backend is simplier than I thought. However, its also hard to master it looks, since theres a lot of layers I could do to make sure my server is running well and effectivly.
- What are you struggling with?
  - I can get a working API but its a little harder to do more advanced things like know when to set virtuals or how functions super work within the server. The second part of that though is not as a big worry, and virtuals I think I just need more time messing around with.
- What would you count as a victory?

  - The fact that monday I fully finished the lab within the end of class and had a whole 15 mins to spare. This hasn't happened for a bit so it was a nice victory, to be done and go home with little to do.
