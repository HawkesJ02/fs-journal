## Questions

1. What is the purpose of a Query String?

- A query string is like a searchbar inside of a website. It lets you tack information on to the end to get specific things within the site. 

2. What is the format of a query parameter? How does it start? How do you distinguish between one parameter and the next?

- The start of the string is the base url of the website. The rest uses ? (query) = (input) & then repeats that.

3. When do you think Query parameters would be helpful when writing your server?

- When you have a lot of data and don't want to sort through it all, or when you just want to be nice. The more data you have the less you're going to want to search for it one by one.
