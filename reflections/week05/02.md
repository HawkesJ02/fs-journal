## Questions

1. What are the three types of relationships?

  - One to One, in which its well one to one, author only talks to address.
  - one in many, in which one is assigned to x amount of possible ties on the right. 
  - many to many, in which left could be many, right could be many but they are still unified under a single purpose.

2. What are the benefits of the traditional `linking` of relationships instead of `Embedding`

- been around awhile more and seems to be more straightforward. Its not too hard to understand but embedding is a bit more complex but says to be more efficient. 

3. What are some of the challenges faced when deciding how to manage a many-to-many relationship that ultimately drive your decision on how to create it?

- It could posissibly be massive, the example there was just the category drama, which could have thousands of books in it. To decide how to create it you can look at what ways you want your embedding to function, one-way, or third collection ect.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment

- The boost in morale I needed. This server backend makes a lot more sense than for example a put request in the front-end. It was a nice breath of "ok, maybe I'm not terrible at this" and worked  much more smoothly than I thought. For once I fully completed the lab and had some time to spare! A whole 20 mins.
