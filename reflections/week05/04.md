## Questions

1. What is a virtual property?

- they are like tiny snippets of other data, refrences to others. You can put them where they are needed to refrenece other data but not link fully back to the original product as they don't get persisted in the database.

2. When might you use a virtual property? 

- IF I need to callback something or link a set of data to another. Like if I want to link a user Id to a name and another piece of data like a set picture.

3. How do you search by a virtual properties value?

- As far as I can tell virtuals are not open to this. But I think I might be thinking of search queries within the string so it may be a simple .get function.
