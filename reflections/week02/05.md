# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?

- Once I got to getting it working a bit everything just flowed. Tuesday and Weds I was a bit stuck feeling, but then come yesterday it just slotted together somehow. So today I hope that feeling can come back with the checkpoint.

- What did you learn as a shock or suprise?

- Refractoring my code was easier than I thought it would be, and it saves a lot more time. instead of 5 functions that do the same thing I could set it to just 1 and have a fraction of the lines.

- What are you struggling with?

- Accessing and drawing from an array is still somewhat hard. Drawing the new array to the screen is also hard but I think with some tinkering that I could get it working, just need to spend some time on the grindstone and get to working through it. 

- What would you count as a victory?

- yesterday's assignment was incredibly fun and rewarding. That was when it clicked yesterday and working with a partner also helped this concept click.
