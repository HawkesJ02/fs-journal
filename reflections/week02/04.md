## Questions

1. What are the benefits of making a plan before starting to just write the code?

-Its a LOT easier to tinker around with ideas and whatnot BEFORE your trying to right good code that works.

2. How do you find answers when you are stuck?

-Me personally if I'm here, try to work through it a bit, if I cannot ask a TA. If I'm at home and stuck, tough luck for me I must read the docs.

3. From the entire article what are your biggest takeaways?

- write down brainstorming before coding.
- NOT using google :), it helps saves time.
- Not writing enough test, test small. small things stack into big things bit by bit.
