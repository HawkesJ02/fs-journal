## Questions

Write a review and reflection of your experiences in this course, as this is the last lecture before your `final project`, what are your concerns, how do you plan to manage your time, what have you enjoyed most about the course up to this point.

- The course was not and is not easy, since I'm not done yet. It went fast but that is not a bad thing, I have learned a lot since about 3 months ago, but there is still so much more that I want to learn. The only thing I have for a concern is finding a job once this final is over. For now though I must focus on the final, be smart and continue onward. The thing I have enjoyed most about this course is the people, my classmates and the staff are quite nice. The staff especially is full of people who both like and are great at teaching.
