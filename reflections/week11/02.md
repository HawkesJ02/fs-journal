## Questions

1. What is the difference between a `primary key` and a `foreign key`

- Primary key belongs to the table it exist on and refrences that. A foregin key can be exported/imported to reference or join another table.

2. What is an `Alias`?

- Another name for something. You can alias out parts of the table for renaming to use elsewhere.

3. Demonstrate how you would query a join statement that would get all of a doctors patients from the following collections:

```SQL
CREATE TABLE doctors (
  id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  -- CODE OMITTED
  PRIMARY KEY (id)
)

CREATE TABLE patients (
  id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  -- CODE OMITTED
  PRIMARY KEY (id)
)

CREATE TABLE doctors (
  id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  doctorId INT NOT NULL,
  patientId INT NOT NULL,

  FOREIGN KEY (doctorId)
    REFERENCES doctors(id),
  FOREIGN KEY (patientId)
    REFERENCES patients(id),

  JOIN patients ON patientId
)

```

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment

- I actually had to spend the day doing stuff for career services. That was nice I got my resume draft done and some other things, but I of course still coded a little, more C# workings.
