# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?

- Feel much better about C# that went well. Its still new feeling to me but its not nearly as bad as last monday.

- What did you learn as a shock or suprise?

- C# kinda just clicked, I'm not great at it but at one point it just made a lot more sense than I thought it would.


- What are you struggling with?

- Oddly enough I have one problem, I still am not quite sure how to change a variable in the API controller when looking for Id. Its something I will have to find some resources for. 

- What would you count as a victory?

- still here! just have to pass the final and that's that, I will have passed the course.Its hard to believe it has already been 11 weeks.
