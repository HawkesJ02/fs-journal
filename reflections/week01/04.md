## Questions

1. What is the purpose of wire-framing? 

-Wire framing helps set out the general idea of how the website is going to look before the actual production of said site. Its much easier to use and to lay out than trying to do that solely with the hard code.

2. What are the different levels of detail in wire-frames and why is each one useful?

- quick sketches are useful to get more vauge layouts but then with more detailed wireframing you can more or less make a complete mock of the site you want to create which just makes it easier.

3. Do you think wire-frames are worth the Time, Energy, and Effort that they require? Why or Why not?

- Yes. They save a great deal of time establishing what the site will look like so I don't have to fiddle around with it while trying to juggle the code as well.
