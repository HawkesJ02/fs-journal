# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?
- What did you learn as a shock or suprise?
- What are you struggling with?
- What would you count as a victory?

- This week was a lot of fun, somewhat low stress so we will see how week two ramps up. I learned just how simple and yet unsimple it is to code a website and lay out all the designs. I struggled with getting the containers and columns to work right but overall had a good time. My victory is that I feel like my checkpoint shaped up nicely but we will see come monday.
