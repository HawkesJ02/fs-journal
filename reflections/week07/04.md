# Sprint Retrospective

![replace_me](https://codeworks.blob.core.windows.net/public/assets/img/illustrations/placeholder.svg)

## Reflect on your partner project and answer the following questions

1. Which principles from this weeks reading did you implement?

- Being 100% crystal clear none of them, because I simply did not have enough time. However, user experience is something I want to excel in since having that connection to users is really what drives me to even do any programming. Making things for people that leaves them satisfied

2. What went well this week?

- Time boxing went well, I am happy I didn't get stuck on anything for long. There were some rough patches but they got smoothed out. 

3. What would you do differently?

- I wish I had just gotten through some things a bit quicker. I got the project done but I personally think it looks horrid, not enough time for styling.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment

- another day to work on the project, again it went well but some things I got hung up on. Luckily not for long and there was good advice in areas I was having trouble with.
