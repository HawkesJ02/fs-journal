## Questions

1. What is Code Documentation? What are some of the ways to document code?

- Code doc is more or less writing down how either code functions or how it was written, ideally both. You can use like a read-me in github or among other things like JSDoc. 

2. What are some benefits of Code Documentation?

-  When you come back months later you can know what the heck you even did. Or when you have coworkers you can pass of the knowledge of how to use your code easier since its documented.

3. How important is Code documentation and why?

- Its pretty important, especially for work. Personal projects you just risk the habit of loosing how you did things yourself but if its for work you need proper docs to be able to effectively handoff things.
