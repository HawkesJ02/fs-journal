# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?

- I felt proud of my timeboxing and moving onto things when I needed too. When things took too long for me or I got annoyed I just took a break and worked on something else for a bit.

- What did you learn as a shock or suprise?

- vue is a powerful tool for styling and general frontend. I'm still very much learning it but I feel I my brain growing everyday.

- What are you struggling with?

- There is always some simple logic thing I feel like I get stuck on. It takes me a bit because it something I may not have done before but they're usually simple fixes.

- What would you count as a victory?

- That I passed the checkpoint! Its a big victory to me. This one the fullstack vue project and it was hard but I did it.
