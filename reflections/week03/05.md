# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?

  - I feel happy with the learning I've done, the progress made. I gave all the labs my best and put the work in. 

- What did you learn as a shock or surprise?

  - Going from 3 docs to at least 9 docs was a hard transition, it surprised me just how easily they stack up. However once I feel I can get comfortable with them it should go much smoother.

- What are you struggling with?

  - Its hard to remember how to call and use all these new functions that do more or less the same things as last week. They do roughly the same things but calling and knowing where to put them is still hard. hard, but doable.

- What would you count as a victory?

  - The fact that I tried, it may not be 100% working on all the labs but darn it I tried, I asked questions when I needed too and I reflected on where to improve. Although I am nervous about this weekly checkpoint I know it can be done.
