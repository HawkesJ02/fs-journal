## Questions

1. What are the two common operations that we will set in the handler?

- Get, which is a basic object operation. And set which sets a new key for the object to make our proxy.  

2. What do you have to make sure you are doing with every Get to ensure the value does not become `undefined`?

- As far as I can tell the operator takes in two parameters. One is the object itself for the proxy and the other is the property that is being accessed. 

3. What are some of the benefits of the proxy object that we are using in our structure for applications?

- You cannot change the proxy object, the proxy object is a safe stand in for the real object. The real object is locked awhile and cannot be changed (hopefully) by the user.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment

- I didn't get as far as I had wanted, but I bet with a little more time, at least an hour of work I probably could. It was easier and harder due to jake's code being thrown about, some things I had a nice refrence, and some things kinda just turned into a weird mess. Overall though I am happy with my work.
