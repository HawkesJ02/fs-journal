> **ðŸ“– [The Observer Pattern](https://codeworksacademy.com/fs-student-guide/resources/wk3/04-Observer-Pattern)**

## Questions

1. What problems does the Observer Pattern seek to solve?

- It stops two way data communication, so the user cannot change things as easily. It turns otherwise two way communication from the DOM to the data and makes it one way only.

2. What are the three mechanisms of the observer pattern?

- The subscribe method,
- The unsubscribe method,
- The broadcast method, 

3. Review the code generated from the bcw-template and reflect on the proxy objects from yesterday, and your understanding of the observer pattern today. With this knowledge, explain how the magic of the bcw-template uses these two concepts to manage and update the dom.

- Exporting classes from the controller, and the controller talks to the service but it never manipulates the actual data. The service is the one that does that and important functions are done in private areas outside of exported classes but in such a way that they are still being able to be ran and used by what needs them.
