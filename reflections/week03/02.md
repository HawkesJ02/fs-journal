## Questions

1. What is the purpose of Encapsulation?

- Isolate functions and responsibilities based off of what they do. This helps keep the code cleaner and more secure, since say the logics of a function are locked behind something the user cannot easily access through the controller.

2. What were some of the problems with closures and the underscore prefix?

- While they sorta work they are not as solid and rigid as true encapsulation. Its safer to lock away things within encapsulation than it is to just use an underscore, which relies on convention.

3. How do we create private variables in a ES6 Class? Why would you do this?

- To do this you put it outside the class, or the exported class and denote it with an underscore. Being outside the class does not allow the user to call it from the exported class but it does allow the class to run the function if needed.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment

- Easier to work with encapsulation and MVC but its still tricky. I've had a little more practice knowing where to start and what to do but its still much harder to read than it was with my humble 3 total files.
