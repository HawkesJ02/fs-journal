## Questions

1. What problem does using exports solve?

-Organization, its easier (in theory) to read and know what everything does. You can state it once and that can be grabbed and reused elsewhere. 

2. How does export differ from export default?

export values you can assign manually, with each one there own work. Or export default, which has default values. 

3. What is a benefit of using the Module System?

-Reusability, less cluttered code everywhere. This way you can determined what sections of things do and call to them rather than dumping it all into one large giant chunk.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment
