## Questions

1. What are lifecycle hooks? What are lifecycle hooks used for?

- Lifecycle hooks are more or less guides for the DOM to tell them when comps are created. There's many types of hooks like creation, mounting and more.

2. How have you utilized lifecycle hooks in your afternoon projects?

- In theory I should be using them to update the DOM and draw data to the screen reactively. This is a bit hard for me to do because I'm just not quite aware of how to use them properly.

3. What are mounting hooks? When might you use them?

- Mounting hooks run an action on loading of the page. This is useful for when you navigate into a new vue page within the app.
