## Questions

1. What is a nested route?

-If a page is a route then its a single route. Nested routes are routes within routes that allow for even more complexity.

2. When might you use a nested route? (other than the provided example)

- The more complex the application the more routes one is likely to have. If you want to go to pages within pages, not particularly new topics but subtopics this is useful.

3. Can you pass parameters through nested routes? When might you use them?

- yes, you can. This might be useful when passing down IDs or something akin to this.
