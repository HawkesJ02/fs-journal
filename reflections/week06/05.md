# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?

  - learning vue seems like a powerful tool and can help create big assignments in a shorter amount of time. I like that this has so much potential to help me *do* that. 

- What did you learn as a shock or suprise?

  - I'm not sure anything about a shock or suprise but its hard going from MVC to view. Its just more learning that I have not mastered yet.

- What are you struggling with?

- A lot more than I thought I was, I just somewhat understood MVC and the backend and going to vue is just a very painful lesson.

- What would you count as a victory?

- I'm writing this after I've done the checkpoint. So, sunday night, the fact that I got 80% of the checkpoint's requirements is a victory because this one was a struggle. I will need to ask a lot more questions next week.
