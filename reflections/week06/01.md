## Questions

- Component based architecture is breaking down larger bits into, well components. Modularized coding if you will, small parts adding up to a greater whole.

2. What are some benefits of Component based architecture?

- small workable spaces, its easy to work within a single file and not have to look through an outstanding number of coding lines. If something breaks it should also be in practice easier to find. 

3. What are some drawbacks to Component based architecture?

- Lots of files start adding up, while they are small its easy to have lots and lots of small files. It is also easy to over engineer and could possibly bloat the amount of files you have to a quite large degree.
