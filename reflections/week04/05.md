# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?

  - hard week of learning but I'm happy with the progress I've made. I'm pretty decent at about 75% of CRUD but the put is still a bit tricky.

- What did you learn as a shock or suprise?

  - how easy it is and how annoying it is to interact with APIs. They have great potential to be used and I am eager for next week.

- What are you struggling with?

  - The update part of CRUD. it shouldn't be that hard but it always feels easier to just make or delete an entry in an API. 

- What would you count as a victory?

  - That I'm still here surviving, which sound dramatic but hey, I'm happy. Classes are fun, and that hasn't happened in a long while for me.
