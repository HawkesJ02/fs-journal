## Questions

1. What is the purpose of `Async`/`Await`?

- Delays a function to be ran after something, like say a promise is fulfilled. It happens OUT of the normal timeframe. 

2. What must you do in order to  `await` a promise inside of a function?

- set Async on the outside otherwise it won't work. and if it leads down make sure all the things that need await have them.


3. What are some of the primary benefits of `Async`/`Await`?

- it further pushes the function down. this is helpful for when you need to wait for something to get done first or it relies on another function for data.
