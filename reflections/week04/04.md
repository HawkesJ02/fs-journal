> **ðŸ“– [The Fetch API](https://codeworksacademy.com/fs-student-guide/resources/wk4/04-Fetch)**

## Questions

1. What does REST stand for, and in simple terms what does it mean? 

- REpresentational State Transfer. The server will give the client a representation of a part of the server state.

2. What does Stateless mean?

- Stateless does not remember anything about the user to the API. Doesn't know what the user has gotten already, ect.

3. What URL pattern is used when writing a RESTful API?

  - I'm not 100% sure about this one, but I believe its just a GET. The example there was a username that its getting to be unique in the URL. I also learned about twitter a little bit so that was a fun random fact.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment

- very fun on this assignment, helped drill down on lessons in the week. I feel like I'm pretty solid on everything but the UPDATE part of CRUD, which is the most complex for me.
