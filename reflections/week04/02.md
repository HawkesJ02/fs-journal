## Questions

1. What are the three states of a `Promise`?

- Pending: promise has been declared but not resolved or rejected
- Resolved: promise has gone through and been completed
- Rejected: promise has tried to run but not been completed

2. How do `promise`s seek to resolve the issues of "callback hell"?

- You attach callbacks to promises, and then chain then. This way, how they're chained, it looks much cleaner and is easier to read than callbacks after callbacks.

3. What is the difference between `.then()` and `.catch()`?

- The .then is used when the promise is completed and resolved, this allows you to decide what happens when the promise gets completed. The .catch is for rejected promises and determining what happens then.
