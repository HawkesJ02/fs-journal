> **ðŸ“– [Callback Hell](https://codeworksacademy.com/fs-student-guide/resources/wk4/01-Callbacks)**

## Questions

1. What are some of the signs and causes of `Callback Hell`?

- Signs are very long and pyramid looking functions, where it is just massive and keeps calling back to them. The cause of this is people want to write JS top-down like other programming languages but its not quite the same in JS.

2. What does the asynchronous mean and how are callbacks involved?

- Asynchronous means that it happens outside the typical state of things. For callbacks they code will run, it will "skip" over the callback and then run it at a later time.

3. Summarize the 3 ways to avoid / fix `Callback Hell`

- Keep the code shallow, small.
- Modularize everything so you can use it as a reference value later on. 
- Handle errors, plant snares in your code to catch errors that (you) or otherwise occur so you know what line broke on what.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment

- Pretty fun! Easier to grasp than last week's monday, hopefully this means I've learned a bit. Mine doesn't look pretty but I got the correct data I wanted drawing to the screen from an API.
