## Questions

1. In a SQL table, what is the difference between information in a row and information in a column?

- Row is one set of data. Its kinda like an object in JS, column is just another set of data or object in this example.

2. Demonstrate the basic structure for creating a new table called `characters` with the values `name, age, description` as strings, and an `int` id.

- CREATE TABLE characters(
  id int NOT NULL,
  name VARCHAR(15) NOT NULL,
  age int NOT NULL
  description VARCHAR(500)
);

3. What are the difference between the following statements: 

-Deleting from a table will delete whatever you choose and leave the table itself. Dropping a table will delete the entire table including itself, not just leave an empty table.

```sql
DELETE FROM table_name;
DROP TABLE table_name;
```
