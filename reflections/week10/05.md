# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?

- C# is hard but not impossible, some things i like some things I do not. It has its uses, I can see where but admittly I think I like using mongo and all that.

- What did you learn as a shock or suprise?

- the transition to c# was not as hard as I thought. Its most certainly not easy but its not impossible.

- What are you struggling with?

- just some minor things, c# still takes me longer than I would like to setup in the backend. But I think I could work this out or ask for help if really needed. 

- What would you count as a victory?

- Another week done and dealt with. I'm still here, not out yet!
