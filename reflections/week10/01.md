## Questions

1. What are the three categories of data types? How are they different?

- Value type, pointer type and refrence type. Value is data within its own space, pointer  types are kinda strange, they are somewhat like reference but have no inheritance from objects.Refrence uses another set of data and simply refrences those without storing it.

2. What are the Value-type data types? What differences do you notice from JavaScript?

- bool, byte, char, deci, ect. Many more, in C# it is much more precise. data is much more strict.

3. In your own words how do Reference types get stored in memory? How does this differ from Value types?

- Values types store the memory I suppose in a way locally within themselves. Refrence types have that data stored in another location and just pull it from there.
