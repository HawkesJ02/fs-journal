## Questions

1. What is an Enum, and what are some use cases for them?

- Enum is like a list of options to choose from. You can use this if you want the user to have a limited choice but not so limited it only uses numbers or something like this.

2. How can you modify an Enum?

- You can add to them, remove from them but once you set it up that is more or less it. The user will have that limited scope to choose from. 

3. How have you used Enums in your afternoon lab projects this far?(if you have not yet, give an example of how you could)

- I have used enums before to select colors for example. The user can choose this limited color pallet to select a colored note or a type of event.
