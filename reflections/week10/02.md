## Questions

1. What is a List in C#?

- A list is a generic type. Its sort of like a collection of data that can just be searched through much easier.

2. What List methods seem like you might use them often? Why?

- List.Add is pretty nice, basic uses. Another neat one is List.Contains that helps me search through them, there are many functions.

3. How would you retrieve an item from a list? What method could you use?

- List.Find which is specfic than list.contains. List.Find will give you back the first thing it found using that criteria.
