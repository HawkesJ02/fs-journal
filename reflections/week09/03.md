## Questions

1. What is a Base64 Encoded Image?

- It is an image encoded with binary data. Althought it may have been more useful in the past its by far not the best option today. 

2. What are the drawbacks of using Base64 Encoding?

- It still works but it does increase the file size by a considerable degree. It also adds some minor load on the CPU that can stack up.

3. Why are these drawbacks issues in this day and age versus in the past?

- Today we expect things to load quickly and faster. Which for the most part is true, but we also just have diffrent way of doing things so this older system is just not quite as good anymore.
