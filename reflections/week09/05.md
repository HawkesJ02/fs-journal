# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?

- We worked well as a team that I knew we could keep it, which I wasn't doubting but you never know. Luckily we did great so I am happy.

- What did you learn as a shock or suprise?

- Some task are just hard to timebox, they feel easy to do but take much longer. This causes some minor delays but we worked through it.

- What are you struggling with?

- This week was somewhat free of struggles since I had so many peers to work with. I don't think we got stuck stuck on anything for long but I do remember I should name things better.

- What would you count as a victory?

- Our capstone is done and I think looks pretty nice! I am happy that we worked well together and our finished product.
