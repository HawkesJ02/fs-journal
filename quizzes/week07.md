# Advanced Front-End Frameworks


**1.** Describe the two ways to bind Data in Vue?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
Directives and interpolations. There's a whole document here with all the nice syntax I found. 
```

**2.** The `SPA` acronym stands for what?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
Single Page Application. Althought Vue is fun because you can do like psuedo MPAs
```
**3.** What are some of the advantages/uses of a `SPA` over a traditional one?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
The biggest one is a single domain. You're URL may change but the base domain is the same, to the standard user (AKA me 7 weeks ago) I couldn't even tell the difference.

```
**4.** What does the `onMounted` method in Vue do?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
When the page is loaded or brought into view by the user.
```
**5.** What is the `v-model` attribute in Vue for, and when might you use it?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
It implements two way binding.
```
**6.** The `v:on` (`@`) directive can be used for what?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
it handles events. The biggest example I can think of is v-on click which allows you run functions on click. 
```
**7.** Which Vue attributes(directives) could you use to conditionally render elements on a page?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
V-if and V-else are my favorite since they are simple and easy to use. Quite powerful too. 
```
**8.** What is the purpose of the `key` attribute when using `v-for` on an element?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
It tells it what to run and what to v-for over. Its still a bit tricky for me.
```
**9.** What is the `<slot>` element and what is it used for?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
These I'm still shakey on but as far as I know they let you slot other templates or any other template content into it.
